# Welcome to Armand's C++ Tutorial
## 1.) Pre Notes

These notes are what I have gathered in my first year on university.
Go through the notes to determine what you understand and don't understand.

### How to start:
Linux: 
  
  1. Download an IDE, I prefer VSCode, however there are many.
      
       [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
      
       [Atom](https://atom.io/)
      
       [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
  
  2. Download a compiler to be able to read your C++ code.
      
      `$ sudo apt install build-essential` 

Windows:
 
 1. Download an IDE, I prefer VSCode, however there are many.
      
       [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
      
       [Atom](https://atom.io/)
      
       [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
 
 2. Download a compiler:

## 2.) Sort.cpp 

As a programmer understanding that different types of algorithms can be used for 1 functionality is key.
Many people go and do Post Graduates in how each compiler differs but still works the same. 
The sorting function can be used with:
`sort()`

However this isnt always possible Ie. Assembly.

To run this file we need a G++ or a GCC compiler.
For this I used a G++ compiler.

To compile:
`g++ -o filename sort.cpp`

This will compile to a binary dot exe file that is an executable.

## Notice : In App

I coded the ascending and descending part to be answered as a lower case. Ie.

`[x] Ascending`

`[100%] ascending`

## The different types of sorting functions:

1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort 
3. Quick Sort
4. Insertion Sort
