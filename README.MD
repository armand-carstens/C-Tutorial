# Welcome to Armand's C++ Sorting Tutorial

To run this file we need a G++ or a GCC compiler.
For this i used a g++ compiler.

To compile:
`g++ -o filename sort.cpp`

This will compile to a binary dot exe file that is an executable.

## Notice : In App

I coded the ascending and descending part to be answered as a lower case. Ie.
`[x] Ascending`
`[100%] ascending`

## The different types of sorting functions:

1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort 
3. Quick Sort
4. Insertion Sort
